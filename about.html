    <h4><b>About Me</b></h4>
    <p> My name is Jay Gopani and I am a softmore at the school Phillip O berry. I live in the United States of America, specifically Charlotte, North Carolia, where I have
        spent the most of my time in. I've lived here all my life and I have a younger brother. In school, I mainly focus on academics and major goals that benefite me in the future
        such as college planning. I am very interested in the computer science field where I get to interact with technolgy and be able to code them in so many possible ways to accomplish
        tasks, goals, or even help other people in their everyday lives. My passion is in computer science and in creating this portfolio I hope to share my passion with you and make you 
        fell the same way I do.
